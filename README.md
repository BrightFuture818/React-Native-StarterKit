React Native Starter Kit
=======

### Out of the box

Contains the following items all setup and ready to go:

1. Hamburger Menu via https://github.com/Kureev/react-native-side-menu
2. Navigator with routing via https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigator.html
3. Custom Navbar via https://github.com/Kureev/react-native-navbar
4. TabBarIOS via https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tabbarios.html#content
5. An example directory/file structure I've found useful for scaling apps
